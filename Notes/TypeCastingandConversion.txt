byte b = 127
int a 256
b = a //trying to store byte in int. -> This wont work.
but a = b // this works.

Why? -> in first case we try storing an integer value a (greater range) in a short type variable b, but as range of int is greater, storing it in a smaller range datatype variable always creates a risk of non accomodation hence lossy storage, so it is not allowed in java implicitly rather it needs an explicit type conversion.

Explicit conversion :- b = (byte) a; // ✅ Now works, but may lose data (256 becomes 0)

Why does a = b; work?
You’re assigning a byte (smaller range) to an int (larger range).

No data loss risk here.

Java automatically allows it.

✅ This is called widening type conversion (done automatically)

🔁 Final Polished Explanation:
In Java, when we try to assign a larger data type (int) to a smaller one (byte), it causes a compilation error because of the risk of data loss — this is called narrowing conversion, and Java doesn't allow it without explicit casting.

However, assigning a smaller data type (byte) to a larger one (int) is safe and allowed by default — this is called widening conversion.


❓ Is float to int conversion implicit in Java?
❌ No. It is NOT implicit. You need to do it explicitly.

✅ Why?
Because float → int means you're moving from:

A floating-point type (float)
➡ which can store decimal values (like 5.75, 3.14, etc.)

To an integer type (int)
➡ which stores only whole numbers (like 5, 10, etc.)

There is a clear risk of data loss — the decimal part will be truncated, not rounded.

float pi = 3.14f;
int x = pi;     // ❌ Compilation error
or
int x = 3.14f   // ❌ Compilation error


Conversion	    Allowed Implicitly?	             Reason
int → float	        ✅ Yes	                No risk of data loss
byte -> int         ✅ Yes                          ""
int -> byte         ❌ No                       Risk of data loss
float -> int        ❌ No                              ""



//A case of explicit type conversion of int to byte
byte b = (byte) 257;

byte range in Java: -128 to 127 (total 256 values)

You're trying to fit 257 (which is an int) into byte

This causes overflow, and Java wraps the value around

🧠 How does Java handle it?
Java only keeps the last 8 bits (1 byte) of the number.

So let's convert 257 to binary:

arduino
Copy
Edit
257 in binary = 00000001 00000001   ← (in 16-bit)
Java takes the last 8 bits: 00000001

That's 1 in decimal

✅ So: b = 1
